        "answer": "Distance vector protocols make routing decisions based on distance metrics (hop count, bandwidth) and direction (vector) advertised by neighboring routers. They have limited view of the network topology, relying on secondhand information from neighbors. Examples include RIP and EIGRP (though EIGRP has advanced features).\n\nLink-state protocols maintain a complete database of the network topology by flooding link-state information throughout the network. Each router independently calculates the best path to all destinations using Dijkstra's algorithm. Examples include OSPF and IS-IS.\n\nKey differences: 1) Distance vector uses rumor-based routing, link-state uses complete topology knowledge, 2) Distance vector has slower convergence, link-state converges faster, 3) Distance vector is prone to routing loops, link-state is loop-free, 4) Distance vector uses less CPU/memory, link-state requires more resources, 5) Link-state scales better for large networks.",
