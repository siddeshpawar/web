        "answer": "A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks like the Internet.\n\nFirewall operation: 1) Packet filtering - examines packet headers and blocks/allows based on rules, 2) Stateful inspection - tracks connection state and context, 3) Application layer filtering - inspects content and application protocols, 4) Deep packet inspection - examines packet payload for threats.\n\nTypes of firewalls: 1) Packet-filtering (stateless), 2) Stateful firewalls, 3) Next-generation firewalls (NGFW), 4) Proxy firewalls, 5) Unified threat management (UTM) appliances.\n\nProtection mechanisms: 1) Access control lists (ACLs), 2) Network address translation (NAT), 3) VPN termination, 4) Intrusion prevention, 5) Application control, 6) URL filtering.\n\nModern firewalls integrate multiple security functions and provide visibility into application traffic, user identity, and threat intelligence.",

        "answer": "ACLs (Access Control Lists) are stateless packet filters that make decisions based on packet headers. They examine source/destination IP, ports, and protocols but don't track connection state. ACLs are simple but limited in security capability.\n\nCBAC (Context-Based Access Control) is Cisco's stateful inspection implementation that inspects traffic flows and dynamically creates temporary openings for return traffic. It understands application protocols and provides better security than ACLs alone.\n\nZone-Based Firewall (ZBF) is a modern approach that groups interfaces into zones and applies policies between zones rather than interface-to-interface. It provides more intuitive policy management, better inspection capabilities, and supports hierarchical policies.\n\nKey differences: 1) ACLs are stateless, CBAC/ZBF are stateful, 2) ZBF uses zone-based policies, CBAC uses global inspection, 3) ZBF supports more granular control, 4) CBAC is being phased out in favor of ZBF, 5) ZBF provides better logging and troubleshooting.",
