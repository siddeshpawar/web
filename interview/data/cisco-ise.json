        "answer": "ISE can apply different policies for wired and wireless connections based on network device attributes.\\n\\nDifferentiation methods: 1) RADIUS NAS-Port-Type attribute, 2) Network device type groups, 3) Called-Station-ID (SSID).\\n\\nWired considerations: 1) Single-host vs multi-host modes, 2) Voice VLAN, 3) Critical VLAN, 4) Port security.\\n\\nWireless considerations: 1) SSID-based policies, 2) Controller-specific attributes, 3) Anchor/foreign controller, 4) FlexConnect.\\n\\nPolicy configuration: 1) Separate policy sets, 2) Condition on NAS-Port-Type, 3) Device group-based rules.\\n\\nCommon scenarios: 1) Same user, different access by connection type, 2) BYOD wireless only, 3) Corporate wired-only access.",
