        "question": "What is a VLAN, and why do enterprises prefer VLAN-based segmentation over using separate physical networks?",
        "answer": "A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical segmentation of a Layer 2 network that allows devices to be grouped into separate broadcast domains, independent of their physical location. VLANs operate by tagging Ethernet frames using the IEEE 802.1Q standard, enabling multiple logical networks to coexist on the same physical infrastructure.\n\nEnterprises prefer VLANs because they significantly reduce broadcast traffic, improve network performance, and enhance security by isolating sensitive systems such as finance, HR, or production servers. Instead of deploying separate switches and cabling for each department, VLANs allow efficient utilization of hardware while maintaining strict logical separation. This design also simplifies scalability, as new departments or services can be introduced through configuration changes rather than physical rewiring.",
        "realWorld": "In large organizations such as airports, service providers, or enterprise campuses, VLANs are used to separate corporate users, guest Wi-Fi, security cameras, and IoT devices.

        "answer": "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 protocol designed to prevent loops in switched networks by creating a loop-free logical topology. STP uses the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) to identify redundant links and selectively block certain paths to ensure only one active route exists between any two points.\n\nSTP prevents broadcast storms by placing redundant ports in a blocking state. When a broadcast frame enters the network, it can only travel along the active paths defined by the spanning tree. Without STP, broadcast frames would circulate endlessly in a loop, consuming all available bandwidth and causing network collapse. STP dynamically recalculates the topology if a link fails, unblocking previously blocked ports to maintain connectivity.",

They send and receive untagged Ethernet frames and assign all incoming traffic to their configured access VLAN.\n\nTrunk ports are designed to carry traffic for multiple VLANs simultaneously between switches or between a switch and a router. They use IEEE 802.1Q tagging to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to. Trunk ports can have a native VLAN that sends untagged traffic for backward compatibility.\n\nDynamic ports (DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol) can automatically negotiate whether to become an access or trunk port based on the connected device's capabilities. While convenient, dynamic ports are generally not recommended in production environments due to security concerns and potential for VLAN hopping attacks.",

        "answer": "VLAN hopping is a network attack where an attacker sends traffic to or receives traffic from a VLAN other than their own, bypassing Layer 2 security controls. There are two main types: switch spoofing and double tagging.\n\nSwitch spoofing occurs when an attacker configures their device to mimic a switch and negotiate a trunk link, potentially gaining access to all VLANs. Double tagging involves the attacker sending a frame with two VLAN tags - the outer tag matches the native VLAN, and the inner tag targets the victim VLAN. When the switch strips the outer tag, the frame is forwarded to the target VLAN.\n\nPrevention methods: 1) Disable DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) on all access ports, 2) Configure all unused ports as access ports in a 'parking lot' VLAN, 3) Change the native VLAN on trunk ports to a unused VLAN number, 4) Enable VLAN access control lists (VACLs), 5) Use Private VLANs (PVLANs) for additional isolation, 6) Implement port security to limit MAC addresses per port.",

No MAC learning or frame forwarding occurs.\n\nLearning: The port builds its MAC address table but still doesn't forward user frames. This allows the switch to populate its CAM table before forwarding traffic.\n\nForwarding: The port actively forwards frames and learns MAC addresses. This is the normal operational state for active links.\n\nDisabled: The port is administratively down and doesn't participate in STP.\n\nPorts transition through these states during network convergence.

        "answer": "Cut-through switching begins forwarding a frame as soon as the destination MAC address is read (typically after the first 6 bytes), without waiting for the entire frame to arrive. This provides lower latency but may forward corrupted frames since error checking isn't performed before forwarding. Variants include fast-forward (immediate forwarding) and fragment-free (waits for 64 bytes to ensure no collision fragments).\n\nStore-and-forward switching waits for the entire frame to arrive, performs CRC error checking, and then forwards the frame if valid. This method ensures no bad frames are forwarded but introduces higher latency. Store-and-forward also supports frame size validation and can handle different speed connections between ports.\n\nModern switches often use adaptive switching, automatically choosing the best method based on network conditions. Store-and-forward is typically preferred in enterprise environments for reliability, while cut-through might be used in latency-sensitive applications like high-frequency trading.",

If no frames are received from a MAC address within this period, the entry is removed to conserve table space. The aging timer can be adjusted globally or per-VLAN based on network requirements.\n\nLearning process: 1) Frame arrives with source MAC X on port 1, 2) Switch adds/updates entry: MAC X -> port 1, 3) Frame's destination MAC Y is looked up in CAM table, 4) If found, frame is forwarded only to the associated port, 5) If not found, frame is flooded to all ports in the VLAN except the ingress port.\n\nModern switches can learn thousands of MAC addresses per second and maintain tables with 16K-64K entries depending on the model.",

VTP can add, delete, and rename VLANs automatically across switches.\n\nVTP modes: 1) Server - can create, modify, and delete VLANs, 2) Client - receives and uses VLAN information but cannot make changes, 3) Transparent - forwards VTP advertisements but doesn't participate in VTP, maintains its own local VLAN database.\n\nVTP is often avoided because: 1) A single misconfigured switch can wipe out VLANs across the entire network, 2) VTP version 1 and 2 don't support extended VLANs (1006-4094), 3) Security concerns - VTP doesn't authenticate by default in older versions, 4) Modern automation tools provide better control, 5) The risk often outweighs the benefits in enterprise networks.\n\nBest practices: Use VTP transparent mode, implement manual VLAN configuration, or use modern automation tools like Ansible or Python scripts for VLAN management.",

        "question": "What is the difference between CEF, fast switching, and process switching?",
        "answer": "Process switching is the slowest switching method where the router's CPU processes each packet individually, looking up routes in the routing table for every packet. It's used for features that require special handling but is too slow for normal traffic forwarding.\n\nFast switching uses a route cache to speed up packet forwarding. The first packet to a destination is process-switched, creating an entry in the fast switching cache. Subsequent packets to the same destination use the cached entry, reducing CPU usage. However, the cache must be rebuilt when routes change.\n\nCEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) is the most advanced method, using two tables built in advance: the FIB (Forwarding Information Base) for destination lookups and the adjacency table for Layer 2 next-hop information. CEF pre-computes forwarding information, allowing line-rate forwarding without per-packet CPU intervention. CEF is efficient, scalable, and supports load balancing across multiple paths.\n\nCEF is the default and preferred method on modern Cisco routers and switches. Fast switching is considered legacy, and process switching is only used for special cases like policy-based routing or debugging.",

They can filter both inbound and outbound traffic on routed interfaces and are stateless by default.

        "answer": "Administrative distance (AD) is a Cisco proprietary feature that rates the trustworthiness of routing protocol sources. When a router learns routes to the same destination from multiple routing protocols, AD determines which route is preferred. Lower AD values are more trusted.\n\nDefault administrative distances: 1) Connected - 0, 2) Static - 1, 3) EIGRP summary - 5, 4) External BGP - 20, 5) Internal EIGRP - 90, 6) IGRP - 100, 7) OSPF - 110, 8) IS-IS - 115, 9) RIP - 120, 10) External EIGRP - 170, 11) Internal BGP - 200, 12) Unknown - 255.\n\nAD modification: 1) Per protocol - distance command, 2) Per route - route maps with set distance, 3) Per neighbor - neighbor distance command, 4) Floating static - high AD for backup.\n\nCommon scenarios: 1) Floating static routes (AD > dynamic), 2) Backup routes with higher AD, 3) Protocol migration with AD tuning, 4) Policy-based path selection.\n\nConsiderations: 1) AD is Cisco proprietary, 2) Can cause suboptimal routing, 3) Must be consistent across network, 4) Document all AD changes, 5) Verify with show ip route commands.\n\nAdministrative distance provides flexible control over route selection but must be used carefully to avoid routing issues.",
